# Gene Counts (featureCounts Output)

This folder contains the gene-level count matrix generated during **Layer 2 RNA-seq analysis** of A549 MYC knockdown (siMYC) and control samples.

Gene quantification was performed using **featureCounts**, part of the Subread package, using the GENCODE v45 (hg38) gene annotation.

## 2. How counts were generated

Counts were produced using featureCounts with the following parameters:

- **Annotation:** GENCODE v45 GTF  
- **Mode:** Paired-end  
- **Strand:** Unstranded
