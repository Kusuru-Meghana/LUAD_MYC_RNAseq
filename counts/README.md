# Gene Counts (featureCounts Output)

This folder contains the gene-level count matrix generated during **Layer 2 RNA-seq analysis** of A549 MYC knockdown (siMYC) and control samples.

Gene quantification was performed using **featureCounts**, part of the Subread package, using the GENCODE v45 (hg38) gene annotation.

### **gene_counts.txt**
- Raw gene-level count matrix.  
- Rows = genes (GENCODE gene IDs)  
- Columns = RNA-seq samples:
  - CTRL1  
  - CTRL2  
  - siMYC1  
  - siMYC2  
- Used directly as input for DESeq2.

### **gene_counts.txt.summary**

## 2. How counts were generated

Counts were produced using featureCounts with the following parameters:

- **Annotation:** GENCODE v45 GTF  
- **Mode:** Paired-end  
- **Strand:** Unstranded  
- **Count type:** Exon-based gene counting

Command used (from script):

```bash
scripts/04_featureCounts.sh
