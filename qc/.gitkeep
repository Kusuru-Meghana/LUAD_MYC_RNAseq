# Quality Control (QC)

This folder contains all read-level quality control outputs generated during **Layer 2 RNA-seq analysis** of A549 MYC knockdown (siMYC) and control samples.

QC was performed using **FastQC** (per-sample quality assessment) and **MultiQC** (aggregated summary).

## 2. Summary of QC Results

All FASTQ files passed quality control checks:

- High per-base sequence quality (Phred > 30)
- Very low adapter contamination
- Acceptable duplication levels for mammalian RNA-seq
- GC content consistent with human transcriptomic data
- No significant overrepresented sequence issues

These results confirmed that all samples were suitable for downstream
alignment and differential expression analysis.
